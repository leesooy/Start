      <h3>Distance Learning</h3>
      <p>It was a turning point of my life when I started learning throughout Internet. My inflexible schedule with two young babies and tight budget were always my cliche excuses to put myself off from learning at school.</p> 
      <p>I realized that a learning process could be much easier and available to than I ever thought when I was introduced to Massive Open Online Learning Courses<a href="http://mooc.org/">(MOOC)</a>,which offer large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies.</p>
      <p><img src="Start/tree/master/_images/Distance Learning.jpg" alt="Distance Learning" width="200" height="136" class="flowLeft">Distance Learning opens the way to see the word for me. And now, I hope I can inspire people who are eager to learn just like I was.</p>
