   <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
      <p><img src="images/Soo Photo.jpg" alt="Here I am" style="float:left;width:150px;height:200px;"/>Aloha! It is my pleasure to meet you via my website that I created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript which I learned through Distance Education(eLearning). I am a life-long advocator of eLearning education, dedicated to making a variety of knowledge available to anyone and customizing learning experiences to each student.</p>
      <p>It was a turning point for me to pursue higher education in master's program majoring in Learning Design and Technology at the University of Hawaii.</p>
      <p>For a while, time constraints with inflexible schedule, family events, and tight budget were always my cliche excuses to put off from learning at school.</p> 
      <img src="images/Distance Learning.jpg" alt="Distance Learning" style="float:right;"/><p>Then, I realized the oppurtunities of online learning. Following the learning process has been much more easier and convenient when I was introduced to Massive Open Online Learning Courses<a href="http://mooc.org/">(MOOC)</a>,which offers large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies. For me, Distance Learning opens the door to a whole new world of oppurtunities. </p>
      <p>As the biggest beneficiary of Distance Learning, it is my mission to introduce eLearning to avid learners who seek learning opportunities, but find it hard to do so due to their  circumstances.  </p>
